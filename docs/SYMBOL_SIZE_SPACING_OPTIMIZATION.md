# Symbol Size and Spacing Optimization

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Symbol Size
**Grid Area Usage:**
- Width: 80% → **90%** of screen width
- Height: 70% → **85%** of screen height
- Maximum symbol size: 150px → **160px**

**Symbol to Cell Ratio:**
- Symbol size: 90% → **95%** of cell size
- This means symbols now use ~85% of total screen space (0.9 × 0.95)

### 2. Reduced Symbol Spacing
**Padding Between Symbols:**
- Previous: 10% of symbol size
- New: **5%** of symbol size
- Creates tighter, more cohesive grid layout

**Internal Symbol Padding:**
- Previous: 20px padding inside each cell
- New: **8px** padding inside each cell
- Symbols fill their cells better while maintaining clean edges

### 3. Placeholder Symbol Adjustments
- Border rectangle: 10px → **4px** inset
- Corner radius: 15px → **12px**
- Text positioning adjusted to match new dimensions

## Visual Impact
- **Bigger symbols**: More prominent and easier to see
- **Tighter spacing**: Professional slot machine feel
- **Better screen utilization**: ~85% vs previous ~72%
- **More cohesive grid**: Symbols feel connected rather than floating

## Result
The slot now has that premium feel where symbols are substantial and the reels feel properly filled, similar to professional games like Starburst or Book of Dead where symbols nearly touch and maximize screen real estate.
