# GPT-image-1 Integration Status

## Success! 

Your organization has been verified and you should now have access to the GPT-image-1 model. The implementation is using your Organization ID `org-EbZLwKpoPUaLvuyhZJid8rUF` to ensure proper authentication.

## Features

The GPT-image-1 integration provides:

1. Custom prompt input field for each symbol
2. High-quality image generation
3. Theme-aware prompt construction
4. Symbol-specific context in prompts

## Using the Custom Prompt Feature

1. Click on the "Custom Prompt" button on any symbol card
2. Enter a detailed description of what you want the symbol to look like
3. Click "Generate" to create the symbol using GPT-image-1
4. The generated image will appear in the symbol card and be available in the grid preview

## Prompt Tips

For best results when creating custom prompts:

1. Be specific about visual elements (colors, shapes, style)
2. Include the symbol type context (wild, scatter, high-paying, etc.)
3. Mention the theme of your slot game
4. Specify if you want text included in the image
5. Mention any special effects or visual treatments

## Fallback System

The application includes a fallback mechanism that will use pre-defined mockup images if:
- There's a temporary API issue
- You exceed rate limits
- You encounter any other API errors

This ensures the application always functions, even if image generation hits a snag.
